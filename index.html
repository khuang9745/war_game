			<h2>Rules:</h2>
			<p>
				A deck of the standard 52 cards is divided evenly between 2 players.
				By clicking draw, one random card is revealed from each player.
				The player with the higher card wins both cards, and they are automtically
				put onto the bottom of their stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the cards are of the same rank, This Means War!
				The next card turned will decide who wins both piles (6 cards)
				In the case where the cards are the same rank again, the war will
				continue until a winner appears and they take all the cards from the war.
				Win all 52 cards from your opponent to win the game!
